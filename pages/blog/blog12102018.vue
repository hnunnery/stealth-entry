              Hiring an MSSP offers more than a few advantages to an organization’s
              security team. Your team can start to focus on strategic security
              projects while the MSSP handles the day-to-day monitoring and
              management of your security environment.

              With the almost constant onslaught of massive data breaches and devastating
              security compromises, it’s no wonder company executives and leaders are quickly
              becoming overwhelmed with the worry that they will be next.
            </p>
            <p class="flow-text">
              As much as organizations would like to deny it, regardless of their size or resources
              the ever-evolving threats from cyber criminals can evade even the seemingly best
              protected infrastructures. And if for those who think the rate of compromises is
              going to decrease in upcoming years, the trend is not in their favor.

            <h5 class="primary--text">MSSP vs. House Security Team</h5>
            <p class="flow-text">
              To avoid these potential disasters, many organizations feel compelled to hire
              and train their own in-house security team with around-the-clock monitoring
              and protection. This quickly adds up to ballooning expenses that simply aren’t
              in the budget, so the only option is to have inadequate cybersecurity.
            </p>
            <p class="flow-text">
              However, in-house cyber security teams may not be feasible for some
              businesses.
            </p>
            <p class="flow-text">
              The option that many organizations have chosen is to partner with a trusted
              Managed Security Service Provider (MSSP). An MSSP provides oversight of
              a company’s security systems and processes and may even be conducted
              remotely over the cloud. The menu of services that an MSSP usually offer
              include setting up security on the infrastructure, ensuring regulatory
              compliance, monitoring all threats 24/7, and maintaining strong data
              protection.
            </p>
            <p class="flow-text">
              While the idea of an MSSP may already seem appealing, we have put
              together the top five benefits of an MSSP to help you see how it could work
              for your specific organization, whether you are a small business or a global
              enterprise.
            </p>
            <h5 class="primary--text">Unrivaled Protection</h5>
            <p class="flow-text">
              One of the most significant benefits that MSSPs offer is their superior
              protection. MSSPs typically have advanced solutions that utilize well-tested and
              leading-edge technologies including artificial intelligence, machine learning,
              and

            </p>
            <p class="flow-text">
              Given their wide reach, MSSPs have unique insights into the global landscape as
              well as the latest cybersecurity threats. As threats and criminals evolve, it is also
              beneficial that MSSPs offer their services around-the-clock, with continuous
              monitoring of all security systems and internal infrastructures.

            <h5 class="primary--text">Cost Savings</h5>
            <p class="flow-text">
              A managed security service provider saves organizations significant upfront
              investments in technology as well as predictable costs monthly.

            <h5 class="primary--text">Saving on Salaries</h5>
            <p class="flow-text">
              Many small businesses that assess staffing in-house InfoSec professionals would
              likely be looking at minimum of three employees to handle the technology,
              patching, monitoring and assessments. Given the fact that the
              <a

              >average</a> salary for a qualified InfoSec worker in the $100,000 range, these small
              businesses would need to budget upwards of $300,000 a year on salaries alone;
              this figure obviously does not include costs for office space, trainings, and
              benefits.
            </p>
            <h5 class="primary--text">Saving on Technology</h5>
            <p class="flow-text">
              Unlike companies that have independent cybersecurity experts, MSSPs are able
              to spread the fixed cost of their total technology investment across a large
              customer base, passing that savings onto the customer. In fact, a
              <a
                href="https://www.ibm.com/midmarket/de/de/att/pdf/IDC_Whitepaper_2013_Business_Value_of_Managed_Services.pdf"

              >report</a> from
              the International Data Corporation (IDC) found that companies who switched
              to managed security providers reduced the costs of IT infrastructures by 24%.
              Moving past the savings companies can see from not having their own
              cybersecurity staff, some of the most significant cost savings MSSPs offer is
              associated with technology investments. As mentioned, MSSPs are able to
              constantly stay updated with the latest and greatest technologies, protecting
              against whatever new
              <a

              investing in this technology expensive for individual companies, but also the
              price of licensing and trainings must be considered, as well. MSSPs allow both
              small businesses and large enterprises to replace unpredictable capital
              expenditures with predictable operational costs.
            </p>
            <h5 class="primary--text">Saving on Data Breach Costs</h5>
            <p class="flow-text">
              A final point is that MSSPs help organizations avoid the often-devastating costs,
              both financially and a from a brand perspective, that come from security
              breaches. For instance,
              <a

              >Target</a>’s data breach in 2013 resulted in more than 40
              million credit and debit cards having their information stolen, and cost the
              company over $200 million. The 2014
              <a

                target="_blank"
              >Sonyhack</a> ended up costing the company
              over $40 million in damages, not including the additional amounts that still
              stem from IT repairs, litigations, and investigations. Also, the
              2017
              <a

            <p class="flow-text">
              Although these may seem like extreme scenarios, they are becoming
              increasingly common, causing major losses to large enterprises and completely
              shutting down small businesses. MSSPs help you save your business and your
              reputation by finding and fighting breaches such as these.
            </p>
            <h5 class="primary--text">Security Experts</h5>
            <p class="flow-text">
              For a majority of cases, the experts that provide managed security support
              services are more effective with advanced security measures than in-house
              teams may be. These professionals are specialists in their field and have
              expertise in managing risk, implementing controls, and developing
              customized security strategies for each individual company. The amount
              of

              >training</a> and education these workers have would be financially impossible
              for most companies, further underscoring why an MSSP offers unique
              benefits
            </p>
            <p class="flow-text">
              Along with this, MSSPs have dedicated staff to provide personalized
              cybersecurity services to each business, ensuring they meet all regulatory
              and
              <a

              program specifically for each company’s unique needs, MSSPs are able to
              maximize return on investment while still addressing the most vital priorities.

              Another critical advantage that MSSPs offer is their access and use of the
              technology they leverage to protect their clients. While many companies

              <a

              that will prevent cybercrime.
            </p>
            <p class="flow-text">
              MSSPs not only have operated and tried out a majority of the technologies
              for themselves, but also have the ability to build solutions organically based
              on the individual needs of each client. Their global span allows them to be
              familiar with a huge variety of industries, as well as the best way for their
              technologies to defend against threats in those different fields. This
              experience provides ongoing analytics and data, further helping MSSPs
              evolve and change with the landscape.
            </p>
            <h5 class="primary--text">Reliable Support</h5>
            <p class="flow-text">
              With the growing pressure on executives to perform as well as defend, it’s no
              wonder that a majority of CEOs push the issue of security down to their
              <a

                target="_blank"
              >CISO</a> or
              even general IT security managers. However, in light of all of the recent major data
              breaches, shareholders and other decision makers are beginning to demand that
              detailed security plans be shared, putting more onto the already toppling pile of
              responsibilities. Although these requests are extremely valid, they can quickly
              distract from the core missions and goals that executives have worked so hard to
              put into place.
            </p>
            <h5 class="primary--text">Conclusion</h5>
            <p class="flow-text">
              Cybercrime is evolving at an alarming pace, with even the largest organizations
              facing gaps in their security systems. Without the necessary protections in place,
              these revolving threats could quickly destroy a business, costing millions of dollars
              in the process. Managed security service providers are able to mitigate and
              manage these cybersecurity threats, providing numerous advantages over an inhouse security team. Whether it be unrivaled protection, cost savings, security
              experts, advanced technology, or reliable support, the benefits of MSSPs are clear.
