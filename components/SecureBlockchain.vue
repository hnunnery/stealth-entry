          <p>â€‹Stealth Entry created a patent pending Blockchain encryption solution to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of data in transit and at rest! Our technology provides the power of the Blockchain and Smart contracts to ensure integrity and non- repudiation of transactions, but also it can also provide verified geo-fenced capabilities. Service providers and users can use policy to ensure digital assets can be geo tracked through verifiable locations which will empower clients to deliver trusted peer-to-peer transfer of digital assets using requirements based on policy enforcement for compliance. Parties can now freely use digital assets, while also being able to prove where transactions occurred and enforced by applicable compliance requirements.</p>
